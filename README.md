# DataMiningProject

Problem Summary: There isn’t any way for students to predict their final grade based on their performance during the course and interactions with an online learning environment (moodle) for the course. 
Objective: Investigate Data Mining techniques and implement the most applicable model for the data on Moodle to make predictions on students’ grades. 
Tasks include:
-	Research different data mining techniques 
o	Review the models implemented in similar domains 
-	Review other models that were implemented in the domain of the stated problem.
-	Determine the techniques that are most applicable to making predictions on data of the Moodle format
-	Design a unique model for data prediction in the given context
-	Compare and evaluate the accuracy of the model chosen against existing data models
-	Present the results of the study
-	Visualize the results
